# Database Migrator

## Usage

This project uses [just](https://github.com/casey/just) to abstract the plumbing needed to run Flyway migrations with
our convenience abstractions. As such, all necessary commands are available as _just recipes_.

The preferred way to approach this project is to run
```shell
just --list
```

to list all available recipes with their documentation. Everything should be documented well enough to help you further
from there.
